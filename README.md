# Economies to die for: Impacts on human health embodied in production and trade

## Abstract

Using an extended input-output model of 41 regions, this study evaluates impacts on human health embodied in production and trade. The input-output methodology is used in a similar manner as done in environmental studies related to ecological footprints. The study covers deaths attributable to pollution and payments made to the health industry by economic activities. These measures are assessed when output is delivered to satisfy final demands locally and abroad. Findings show that Bulgaria, China, Indonesia, India, Latvia, Romania, Russia, and the Rest of the World are net producers of fatalities embodied in trade. It can be said that these regions save their trade partners from having to deteriorate the health of their citizens. Conversely, industries with highest levels of payments to the health sector per direct and indirect unit of output intended for final demand are mostly located in the developed world, with the clear exception of China, whose heavy industries appear to be making large investments in human capital per unit of output.
