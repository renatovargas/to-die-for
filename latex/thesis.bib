	Abstract = {This paper compares two concepts to evaluate the international responsibility of a country with respect to its emissions. Using a multi-regional input--output model, we show that the trade emission balance and the responsibility emission balance yield the same result. In practical work, however, a lack of data availability implies that the same technology assumption has been commonly adopted. In that case, also a third alternative exists, which simply evaluates the emissions embodied in the trade balance of the country. This third alternative yields the same results as the other two approaches at the aggregate level. At the level of individual products, however, the results are clearly different and it turns out that the third alternative answers a different question. That is, it is appropriate for measuring the emission content of the products that cross the border. In our empirical application, we consider Spain in 1995 and 2000, distinguishing nine different gases: {CO2}, {CH4}, {N2O}, {SF6}, {HFCs}, {PFCs}, {SO2}, {NOx}, and {NH3.}},

	Abstract = {We analyze the greenhouse gas emissions embodied in trade between Japan and the {US}, extending the Japanese government's linked {Japan--US} input--output model to include carbon emission coefficients for each sector. We estimate that in 1995, {Japan--US} trade reduced {US} industrial emissions by 14.6 million tons of {CO2-equivalent}, and increased emissions in Japan by 6.7 million tons, for a global savings of 7.9 million tons. These quantities are less than one percent of each country's total emissions. Trade with the rest of the world reduced emissions by much larger amounts, roughly four percent of each country's emissions. The sectoral patterns of carbon intensity are strongly correlated between Japan and the {US;} in addition, greater carbon intensity has a small but significantly positive effect on net exports. Policies that tax or otherwise regulate carbon emissions are needed to discourage this destructive route to competitiveness. However, the most important policy implication may be that {US} industry could cut its carbon emissions by more than half if it matched the environmental performance of industry in Japan.},

@article{andrewapproximation2009,
	Abstract = {Multi-regional input--output {(MRIO)} analysis has been widely used to quantify the global environmental impacts (e.g. energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, water use) embodied in consumption and international trade. Often, analysts have used approximations to a full global {MRIO} model; however, without access to a full {MRIO} model the approximation errors are unknown. In this paper we use an {MRIO} model based on the dataset provided by the Global Trade Analysis Project {(GTAP)} to quantify the errors introduced by various approximations of the full {MRIO} model. We find that emissions embodied in imports contribute an average 40\% of the total emissions embodied in countries' final demands. For the emissions embodied in imports, we find: (a) that the unidirectional trade model gives a good approximation to the full {MRIO} model when the number of regions in the model is small; (b) that including only the most important trade partner in terms of emissions embodied in imports can substantially improve the accuracy of estimates; and (c) that a world-average input--output table often provides a good representation of the aggregate `rest of world' economy. Finally, assuming that imports are produced with domestic technology {(Domestic} Technology Assumption, {DTA)} in an {MRIO} model can introduce significant errors and requires careful validation before results are used. However, the {DTA} generally produces better estimates than ignoring imports altogether.},

@article{bicknellnew1998,
	Abstract = {Sustainable development has become a primary objective for many countries throughout the world since the late 1980s. A major difficulty associated with sustainable development objectives, however, is the absence of reliable indicators to measure progress towards the goal of sustainability. The `ecological footprint' provides an estimate of the land area necessary to sustain current levels of resource consumption for a given population. On an aggregate basis, the ecological footprint may be compared with the amount of ecologically productive land available to give an indication of whether consumption patterns are likely to be sustainable. This paper proposes the use of a modified form of input--output analysis to calculate the ecological footprint. The input--output approach provides a consistent means of calculating an ecological footprint using data collected as part of the system of national accounts in most developed countries. In addition, it makes explicit the link between the level of economic activity in a country and its corresponding impact on the environment. An application of this methodology to New Zealand indicates that it takes 3.49 has of ecologically productive land per year to sustain the average New Zealander's current level of consumption.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes to evaluate the consequences of the introduction of a carbon tax for the Belgian economy. To this end, two scenarios are studied. The first scenario introduces a carbon tax of about 23.5 ecus per ton of {CO2} emitted and the second scenario combines the tax with incentives to energy savings investments. The results suggest that the tax, alone, is not sufficient to meet the international requirements as far as a stabilization of {CO2} emissions is required. It is therefore suggested that a policy-mix of pure taxation measures with various forms of subsidies to investments should be achieved.},

@article{calthropdoseresponse1996,
	Abstract = {Following from research conducted in the {USA} there is renewed interest in measuring the health impacts of air pollution. Direct methods of valuing the impact of poor air quality on health are likely to suffer from a variety of problems, chiefly a poor appreciation of the biological impacts of air pollution. However, indirect methods fail to account for averting behaviour and consequently provide only a lower bound on true willingness to pay. Dose---response functions have been estimated using different sorts of statistical models with different statistical properties; and there are arguments for resorting to Poisson regression techniques rather than conventional ordinary least squares routines. The results which emerge may depend upon the nature of the data with time series data failing to capture chronic health effects. The main issue, however, is the overall competence of the statistical studies themselves. In particular there are concerns that the means used to deal with the problem of multicollinearity have biased the results; similarly for the technique of filtering the data to deal with seasonal fluctuations. There are also concerns about the dynamic specification of the models. Most empirical work is likely to involve the use of meta-analyses to combine studies drawn from other countries. But because dose---response functions rest upon chosen behaviour they depend upon baseline factors which underlie individual analyses. Given the magnitude of the claims currently being made concerning the health effects of poor air quality, further research is clearly warranted and should focus on panel data analyses to deal with the problem of multicollinearity, the dynamic specification of the models and on the extent of avertive behaviour.},

Results indicate that the primary factor for the increase of {CO2} emission is the level of domestic final demand and exports; however, the effect of an increasing rate of added value is less obvious. On the other hand, the effects of a decreasing industrial {CO2} intensity is a main reducing factor, next is the structure of domestic final demand, and the rate of domestic production to intermediate input also has partial reducing effects for {CO2} emission. Besides, the structure change of exports has only low reducing effects. Results presented herein can provide valuable information regarding the characteristics and key factors of {CO2} emission in the industrial development process.

	Abstract = {This paper reviews the results of a structural decomposition analysis in which the annual changes in a number of air pollutants and solid waste are decomposed according to their causes. The analysis in this paper is applied with the help of the so-called National Accounting Matrix including Environmental Accounts {(NAMEA)} for the Netherlands, covering annual data for the period 1987-1998. In a sensitivity analysis it is shown that the average of any pair of so-called 'mirror image' decomposition forms will substantially reduce the variation in the estimates. These mirror image couples are approximately just as reliable as the full average of all decomposition forms. Besides reliable results, the full average also foresees the mutual comparability between the distinguished change factors and is therefore applied in the empirical analyses presented in this paper. The results of these analyses contain the macro-economic developments, results on the industry level as well as a comprehensive overview of the origin and destination of pollution in the Dutch economy that includes the environmental consequences of consumption and international trade.},

We calculate the extra {CO} 2 , {SO} 2 and {NO} x emissions induced by 1 billion rupees of additional exports. This is compared with the reduction of Indian pollution caused by an import increase of equal size. In contrast to what the pollution haven hypothesis states for developing countries, we find that India considerably gains from extra trade. Comparing 1996/1997 with 1991/1992, the gains have only increased, indicating that India has moved␣further away from being a pollution haven.

Health is a form of general human capital; labor turnover and labor-market frictions prevent an employer-employee pair from capturing the entire surplus from investment in an employee's health. Thus, the pair underinvests in health during working years, thereby increasing medical expenditures during retirement. We provide empirical evidence consistent with the comparative statics predictions of our model using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey {(MEPS)} and the Health and Retirement Study {(HRS).} Our estimates suggest significant inefficiencies in health investment in the United States. {(JEL} D14, D91, G22, I11, J32) {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}

	Abstract = {Abstract Growing interest in environmental and socio-economic accounting at the sub-regional and organisational level requires a consistent and comprehensive method for computing and reporting responsibility for impacts of industrial production such as water use, pollution, or employment. This work presents a formulation for allocating responsibility for production impacts consistently amongst all agents such as consumers, producers, workers, and investors throughout demand and supply chains, in a way that reflects their contribution to the production process. Generalised input--output theory is used to re-trace the flow of past inter-industrial transactions, and examine ex-post how, for example, inputs of resources or outputs of pollution were associated with these transactions. Introducing the concept of a responsibility share we enable the division of responsibility into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive portions that are assigned to the different economic sectors, and that become consistently smaller as we move away from the location of the impact within the supply or demand chain system.},

	Abstract = {This paper analyzes the inter-relationship of energy development and environmental constraints in China. It examines the effects of economic development, investment, energy trade and environmental limitations in shaping energy development. It highlights the tensions between institutions involved in energy development, energy conservation and environmental protection, and concludes that total fuel mix in China will be diversified in the future. The share of coal in primary energy production and consumption will increase in the short time span till 2020, and diminish gradually thereafter, being largely replaced by gas, nuclear and renewables. China will become a big oil importer, due to increase in demand and resource limitations. Meanwhile, coal export will increase in the long run. {SO2} and {CO2} emissions will become potentially larger in the future, because of the speed of economic growth and lack of effective control measures. Institutional bottlenecks, and political preference to solving local environmental problems, will affect actions to eliminate global environmental risks. There exist huge investment potentials for energy development from both international and domestic private investment funds. Energy efficiency will continue to improve, associated with gradual decline of non-commercial energy use and increasing share of commercial energy in final consumption. Energy conservation holds the key for sustainable energy development, which should be promoted at the national and local levels with demand management as a focus in policy implementation.},

The sub-regional process in South Asia developed through a series of meetings that led to the Mal{\'e} Declaration. In southern Africa a policy dialogue led to the Harare Resolution targeted towards progress in the {SADC} region. A policy dialogue in Buenos Aires concentrated on issues related to regional harmonisation of legal frameworks in the Mercosur region. In all regions the link between scientific information required to support decision making has been emphasised. The sub-regional policy processes are analysed in relation to availability of required scientific information and compared to the process that led to protocol development in Europe.},

	Abstract = {The water that is used in the production process of a commodity is called the `virtual water' contained in the commodity. International trade of commodities brings along international flows of virtual water. The objective of this paper is to quantify the volumes of virtual water flows between nations in the period 1995--1999 insofar related to international crop trade and to analyse national virtual water balances in relation to national water needs and water availability. The basic approach is to multiply international crop trade flows (ton/yr) by their associated virtual water content (m3\&\#xa0;ton−1). The calculations show that the global volume of crop-related international virtual water flows between nations was {695\&\#xa0;Gm3\&\#xa0;yr−1} in average over the period 1995--1999. For comparison: the total water use by crops in the world has been estimated at {5400\&\#xa0;Gm3\&\#xa0;yr−1.} This means that 13\% of the water used for crop production in the world is not used for domestic consumption but for export (in virtual form). This is a conservative estimate because only a limited number of crops----although the most important ones----have been taken into account and because crop products (such as cotton clothes) have been excluded from the study. The countries with the largest net virtual water export are United States, Canada, Thailand, Argentina and India. The largest net import appears to be in Japan, the Netherlands, the Republic of Korea, China and Indonesia.},

	Abstract = {Recently, global warming (greenhouse effect) and its effects have become one of the hottest topics in the world agenda. There have been several international attempts to reduce the negative effects of global warming. The Kyoto Protocol can be cited as the most important agreement which tries to limit the countries' emissions within a time horizon. For this reason, it becomes important to calculate the greenhouse gas emissions of countries. The aim of this study is to estimate the amount of {CO2---the} most important greenhouse gas---emissions, for the Turkish economy. An extended input--output model is estimated by using 1996 data in order to identify the sources of {CO2} emissions and to discuss the share of sectors in total emission. Besides, {`CO2} responsibility', which takes into account the {CO2} content of imports, is estimated for the Turkish economy. The sectoral {CO2} emissions and {CO2} responsibilities are compared and these two notions are linked to foreign trade volume. One of the main conclusions is that the manufacturing industry has the first place in both of the rankings for {CO2} emissions and {CO2} responsibilities, while agriculture and husbandry has the last place.},

	Abstract = {International trade has been incorporating various aspects of environmental issues since 1970. The extent to which environmental problems might affect many facets of trade, or vice versa, has been the subject of considerable debate over these years. In this article we have attempted to establish some of the links between international trade and environmental quality by performing a comprehensive literature review. We discuss issues such as establishing direct and indirect effects of international trade on environmental quality, effects of trade on economic development, environmental quality, and energy and their relation with each other, and, finally, the role of governments and international organizations in this context. Studies have so far revealed some linkages between trade and environment through conventional trade theory. However, interactions between international trade and types of pollution, their sink and assimilative capacity need to be analyzed using a general equilibrium approach. Currently, very little knowledge and agreement on the nature of interactions between trade theories, development process and environmental quality exist. Existing studies have shown that the structure of environmental regulations should be modified to reflect the existence of trade under imperfect competition. Therefore, further research on the interaction between new trade theory and environmental regulation is needed. Also, theoretical and quantitative analysis regarding the effects of environmental regulations on competitiveness and location decision is needed. The intensity and type of environmental measures vary across issues and countries. Therefore, harmonizing environmental measures creates an inefficient atmosphere, and to assume that trade restrictions will either improve or reverse the environmental damages is a serious mistake. Given the dynamic and intricate nature of the problem, trade and environment debate continues despite vast research and poses a challenge for researchers and policy makers in the foreseeable future.},

	Abstract = {This paper develops an index of pollution based on the epidemiological dose-response function associated with each pollutant, and the welfare losses due to exposure to pollution. The probability of damage is translated into welfare losses, which provides the common metric required for aggregation. Isopollution surfaces may then be used to compare environmental quality over time and space. An Air Pollution Index {(API)} is computed using 1997 data for the criteria pollutants under the Clean Air Act {(CAA).} The results are compared with the {EPA's} Pollutant Standards Index {(PSI).} Two significant differences emerge: unlike the {PSI}, the {API} facilitates a detailed ranking of regions by air quality and {API} values may contradict {PSI} results. Some regions with {PSI} values of 100--200 are considered less polluted under the proposed methodology than those with {PSI} values between 50 and 100. The key reason for the difference is that {PSI} values are determined entirely by the gas with the highest relative concentration whereas the {API} value is based on the ambient concentrations of all pollutants.},

	Abstract = {In order to achieve equitable reduction targets, international trade has to be taken into account when assessing nations' responsibility for abating climate change. Especially for open economies such as Denmark, greenhouse gases embodied in internationally traded commodities can have a considerable influence on the national 'greenhouse gas responsibility'. We set up a five-region input-output model including Denmark, Germany, Sweden and Norway in order to calculate {CO2} multipliers and trade balances. We investigate multidirectional feedback between these countries, and hence the error inherent in a single-region input-output model. We also examine the effect of aggregation on the model results. In the case of Denmark, an 11 Mt {CO2} trade surplus resulting from a single-region model turns into balance when multidirectional trade is considered. Moreover, aggregated models are likely to result in significant errors. Therefore, both the type and the degree of aggregation used for modelling {CO2} responsibilities could have a major bearing in international negotiations.},

		Abstract = {Over the past decade, an increasing number of authors have been examining the nexus of producer versus consumer responsibility, often dealing with the question of how to assign responsibility for internationally traded greenhouse gas emissions. Recently, a similar problem has appeared in drafting the standards for the Ecological Footprint: While the method traditionally assumes a full life-cycle perspective with full consumer responsibility, a large number of producers (businesses and industry sectors) have started to calculate their own footprints (see www.isa.org.usyd.edu.au). Adding any producer's footprint to other producers' footprints, or to population footprints, which all already cover the full upstream supply chain of their operating inputs, leads to double-counting: The sum of footprints of producers and consumers is larger than the total national footprint. The committee in charge of the Footprint standardisation process was hence faced with the decades-old non-additivity problem, posing the following dilemma for the accounting of footprints, or any other production factor: if one disallows double-counting, but wishes to be able to account for producers and consumers, then one cannot impose the requirement of full life-cycle coverage; the supply chains of actors have to be curtailed somehow in order to avoid double-counting. This work demonstrates and discusses a non-arbitrary method of consistently delineating these supply chains, into mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive portions of responsibility to be shared by all actors in an economy.},

	Abstract = {All goods and services produced in an economy are directly and/or indirectly associated with energy use and, according to the type of fuel utilized, with {CO2} emissions as well. International trade is an important factor in shaping the industrial structure of a country and, consequently, in affecting a country's energy use and {CO2} emissions. This study applies input--output techniques to the Brazilian economy to evaluate the total impacts of international trade on its energy use and {CO2} emissions. A commodity-by-industry {IO} model in hybrid units (energy commodities in physical units and non-energy commodities in monetary units) is applied to the Brazilian economy in 1995. Results show that total energy embodied in the exports of non-energy goods of Brazil equals 831 {PJ}, while total carbon embodied is 13.5 {MtC.} These amounts are larger than the relevant amounts embodied in the imports of non-energy goods, respectively 679 {PJ} and 9.9 {MtC.} These figures are better understood by contrasting them with the total energy use and the corresponding total carbon emissions of the Brazilian economy in 1995 estimated by this work: 6781 {PJ} and 99.4 {MtC}, respectively. This means that international inflows and outflows of energy embodied in non-energy goods are in the order of 10 and 12\% of the total energy use, while inflows and outflows of carbon embodied in non-energy goods are approximately 10 and 14\% of the corresponding total carbon emissions of the Brazilian economy in 1995. The general picture is that Brazil is not only a net exporter of energy (153 {PJ)} and of carbon (3.6 {MtC)} embodied in the non-energy goods internationally traded by the country in 1995, but also that each dollar earned with exports embodied 40\% more energy and 56\% more carbon than each dollar spent on imports. These findings suggest that Brazilian policy-makers should be concerned about the extra impacts international trade policy may have on energy use and carbon emissions of the country.},

	Abstract = {The estimation of greenhouse gas {(GHG)} emissions associated with international trade and final consumption gives a more complete and balanced picture of the responsibilities of various countries for the emissions that cause the climate change. The aim of this study was to look at the impact of the coverage of the {GHGs} and their sources and assumptions regarding the emissions of imports on the results of {GHG} emissions associated with international trade and final consumption of Finland. In addition to a single year study, a trend covering years 1990--2003 was produced for Finland to study the development of the {GHG} emissions associated with domestic consumption and the reasons behind the development. According to our results Finland was in 1999 a net exporter of {CO2} from fossil fuel combustion, {CO2} from all sources and {GHGs} of 4(4.2), 5 or {7\&\#xa0;Gkg}, respectively. The impact of different assumptions concerning the emissions embodied in imports in the case of Finland was tested by using the domestic emission intensities and the ratios of embodied emissions in imports in relation to domestic products by utilizing the data from the study by {(OECD}, 2003b. Carbon Dioxide Emissions Embodied in International Trade of Goods, {STI} Working Paper 2003/15, {OECD}, Paris). In the case of Finland, the differences of results calculated with these two methods remained rather small. The total emissions embodied in the imports changed from 33.8 to {34.4\&\#xa0;Gkg} and consequently the net export of {CO2} from fossil fuel combustion changed from 4.2 to {3.6\&\#xa0;Gkg.} The results for 1990--2003 show that the {GHG} emissions embodied in the exports have exceeded the {GHG} emissions embodied in the imports from early 1990s. The reason for the increasingly positive {GHG} trade balance in the case of Finland has been the change in the magnitude of trade rather than the changes in its structure. The results show also that the impact of international transport on the emission intensity of imports is significant and merits further research.},

According to our results Finland was in 1999 a net exporter of {CO2} from fossil fuel combustion, {CO2} from all sources and {GHGs} of 4(4.2), 5 or {7\&\#xa0;Gkg}, respectively. The impact of different assumptions concerning the emissions embodied in imports in the case of Finland was tested by using the domestic emission intensities and the ratios of embodied emissions in imports in relation to domestic products by utilizing the data from the study by {(OECD}, 2003b. Carbon Dioxide Emissions Embodied in International Trade of Goods, {STI} Working Paper 2003/15, {OECD}, Paris). In the case of Finland, the differences of results calculated with these two methods remained rather small. The total emissions embodied in the imports changed from 33.8 to {34.4\&\#xa0;Gkg} and consequently the net export of {CO2} from fossil fuel combustion changed from 4.2 to {3.6\&\#xa0;Gkg.} The results for 1990--2003 show that the {GHG} emissions embodied in the exports have exceeded the {GHG} emissions embodied in the imports from early 1990s. The reason for the increasingly positive {GHG} trade balance in the case of Finland has been the change in the magnitude of trade rather than the changes in its structure. The results show also that the impact of international transport on the emission intensity of imports is significant and merits further research.},

	Abstract = {In developing countries the price of rapid growth is all too often noxious airborne pollution, which annually contributes to a disturbing number of avoidable deaths. In recent decades, however, there has been considerable progress in the epidemiology of air pollution, significant changes in international air pollution guidelines, and the emergence of more systematic approaches to air pollution control. While many of these advances have originated in affluent countries, there have been major developments in other parts of the {world.In} this book, a distinguished cast of leading researchers in both the scientific and policy dimensions of air pollution and health have synthesized the recent developments in the field and their relevance for public health in developing countries. The authors review studies from a wide range of Asian, African and Latin American countries and contrast the findings with those from Europe and North America. They also describe various tools and systems for air pollution management and emphasize approaches that can be used when data is scarce. With a clear focus on the scientific and technical aspects of air pollution and health, this book is essential reading for pollution and health policy-makers, researchers and others concerned with air pollution and health in developing countries.},

	Abstract = {In the Kyoto Protocol the absence of Green House Gases {(GHGs)} commitments of developing countries (non-Annex I) and the more flexible terms of implementation which are allowed to countries shifting toward a market economy (transition economies) naturally lead to the absence or to less constraining national measures and policies of reduction of the {GHGs} emissions which, in turn, may determine a comparative advantage in the production of the highest energy/carbon intensive commodities for these countries. These arguments are valid also considering the future implementation of the European Emission Allowance Trading Scheme {(EATS).} Thus, developing countries may become a haven for the production of not environmental-friendly commodities; in this case, the so-called Pollution Haven Hypothesis, stating that due to freer international trade the comparative advantage may change the economic structure and consequently the trade patterns of the countries linked by trade relationships, could occur. This would lead to the increase of the transfers of energy and carbon embodied in traded commodities from developing countries and transition economies toward Kyoto or {EATS} constrained countries.
	
	The aim of this paper is to verify if for Italy, as a Kyoto and {EATS} complying country, evidence of a change in the trade patterns, occurred on the basis of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis, does exist and to estimate the magnitude of the under-estimation of the carbon actually emitted: the carbon leakage.
	
	The {Input--Output} model has been used to calculate the intensities of energy consumption and the related Green House Gases emission, for each Italian economic sector.},

The aim of this paper is to evaluate air pollution {(CO2}, {SO2}, and {NOx)} from fossil fuel combustion in India. {Input--Output} Structural Decomposition Analysis approach is used to find out their sources of changes. We also estimate the emissions of {CO2}, {SO2} and {NOx} for the year 2001--2002 and 2006--2007. A link between emission of pollutants and their impact on human health is finally analysed.
	
	The study categorizes the changes in the amount of {CO2}, {SO2} and {NOx} emissions into four factors: the pollution intensity or eco-efficiency, technology or input-mix, composition of final demand, and the level of final demand. The main factors for these changes were the pollution intensity, technology, and the volume of final demand. Changes in the pollution intensity and technology were in most periods increasing air pollution. These results are quite different to those observed in some other studies. Pollution and health impacts have a close linear relationship and the main factors for the changes are the same as for the pollution.},

	Abstract = {International negotiations of reducing {CO2} emissions address the question of how to account annual {CO2} emissions. For open economies like Denmark facing national {CO2} targets import and export of commodities influence the total accounted {CO2} emissions. In this article we demonstrate the consequences of using two basic accounting principles: a production versus a consumption principle. The distinction between the two principles is whether the producer or the consumer is responsible for the {CO2} emitted. By subtracting total emissions based on the two accounting principles we develop the concept of a {``CO2} trade balance''. Using Denmark as a case, we show that from 1989 to 1994 the {CO2} trade balance has changed dramatically turning into a deficit of 7 million tonnes from a surplus of 0.5 million tonnes in 1987. Consequently, it has become more difficult to reach the national {CO2} target as an increasing part of emissions from Danish territory is caused by foreign demand.},

	Abstract = {The relationship between free trade and the environment is one of the main issues of contention between environmental and ecological economics. Environmental economics assumes a positive relationship between free trade, economic growth and environmental policies. Environmental externalities may cause important damage. However, trade is not to be blamed for this. Instead, the fault lies with policy inadequacies at the national level. On the other hand, some ecological economists criticise the assumptions of environmental economics, especially the immobility of production factors and the positive correlation between income and environmental quality. They plead for measures to prevent deterioration of {`Northern'} environmental standards in a `race to the bottom' due to `ecological dumping'' from the South. In this paper, we argue that neither environmental economics nor {`Northern'} ecological economics take into account the structural conditions determining the international trade system. Based on some new empirical evidence on material flows, we stress the notion of environmental cost-shifting. If physical and political ecology perspectives are adopted, a {`Southern'} approach to the trade-and-environment issue may arise.},

The environmental load of households (direct) and production (indirect) was determined for 360 expenditure categories reported in the Dutch Expenditure Survey. The indirect environmental load was calculated with linked input-output tables covering worldwide production and trade. The environmental load per Euro turnover of industries was linked to consumer expenditures. With this method we can quantify several types of environmental load per expenditure category and per economic production {region.It} was found that food production, room heating, and car use are the most important elements in the environmental load of Dutch private consumption. The impacts taking place abroad were---with the exception of emission of greenhouse gases and road traffic noise---found to be larger than domestic impacts.

Many post-Kyoto frameworks have been debated, but surprisingly approaches that focus on consumption have received little attention in the climate change literature despite broader interest in other areas. In this article we extend the argument for constructing {GHG} inventories using a country's consumption rather than production. First, we argue that constructing {GHG} inventories using a country's economic activity instead of geographic territory solves allocation issues for international activities such as international transportation and carbon capture and storage. Second, we argue that consumption-based {GHG} inventories have many advantages over production-based inventories. The main advantages are to address carbon leakage, reduce the importance of emission commitments for developing countries, increase options for mitigation, encourage environmental comparative advantage, address competitiveness concerns, and naturally encourage technology diffusion.},

@article{petersproduction-based2008,
	Abstract = {Under the United National Framework Convention of Climate Change {(UNFCCC)} countries are required to submit National Emission Inventories {(NEI)} to benchmark reductions in greenhouse gas {(GHG)} emissions. Depending on the definition and system boundary of the {NEI}, the mitigation options and priorities may vary. The territorial system boundary used by the {UNFCCC} has been critiqued for not including international transportation and potentially causing carbon leakage. To address these issues, past literature has argued in favour of using consumption-based {NEI} in climate policy. This article discusses several issues in moving from the standard production-based {NEI} to consumption-based {NEI.} First, two distinct accounting approaches for constructing consumption-based {NEI} are presented. The approaches differ in the allocation of intermediate consumption of imported products. Second, a consistent method of weighting production-based and consumption-based {NEI} is discussed. This is an extension of the previous literature on shared responsibility to {NEI.} Third, due to increased uncertainty and a wide system boundary it may be difficult to implement consumption-based {NEI} directly into climate policy. Several alternative options for incorporating consumption-based inventories into climate policy are discussed.},

	Abstract = {A promising way to reduce environmental impacts of consumer expenditure is through the encouragement of more sustainable consumption patterns. Consumers cause environmental impacts both directly, such as by fuel use in personal cars, and indirectly, by paying for the production of consumables. With increased international trade, the indirect environmental impacts are difficult to determine because a portion of the emissions occurs in different geographical regions. Many previous studies have unrealistically assumed that imports are produced using domestic production technology. For countries with diverging technology and energy mixes the likely errors are significant. This study applies a methodology that explicitly includes technology differences to the case of Norwegian households. It is found that a significant portion of pollution is embodied in Norwegian household imports. Further, a disproportionately large amount of pollution is embodied in imports from developing countries. Overall, as in previous studies, we find that mobility and food are most important in terms of household environmental impacts. By analyzing the imports in more detail we find that for some sectors the majority of emissions occur in foreign regions; in particular, this is true for food, business services, clothing, chemicals, furniture, cars, agriculture, textiles, and most manufactured products.},

	Abstract = {With the increase in international trade, it is becoming increasingly important to accurately determine environmental impacts resulting from pollution embodied in trade. Many previous studies have unrealistically assumed that imports are produced with the technology of the importing country. For countries with diverging technology and energy mixes the likely errors are significant. This study uses a model that explicitly includes regional technology differences to the case of Norway. It is found that {CO} 2 emissions embodied in imports was 67\% of Norway's domestic emissions. Around a half of this embodied pollution originates in developing countries, yet they represent only 10\% of the value of Norwegian imports. In addition the carbon leakage from non-Annex I countries was at least 30\%. We then argue that basing emission inventories on consumption, rather than production, may resolve not only issues related to international trade, but also provide greater flexibility towards pollution intensive resource endowments, emission reductions, and participation levels.},

@article{reesrevisiting1996,
	Abstract = {Conventional wisdom suggests that because of technology and trade, human carrying capacity is infinitely expandable and therefore virtually irrelevant to demography and development planning. By contrast, this article argues that ecological carrying capacity remains the fundamental basis for demographic accounting. A fundamental question for ecological economics is whether remaining stocks of natural capital are adequate to sustain the anticipated load of the human economy into the next century. Since mainstream (neoclassical) models are blind to ecological structure and function, they cannot even properly address this question. The present article therefore assesses the capital stocks, physical flows, and corresponding ecosystems areas required to support the economy using ``ecological footprint'' analysis. This approach shows that most so-called ``advanced'' countries are running massive unaccounted ecological deficits with the rest of the planet. Since not all countries can be net importers of carrying capacity, the material standards of the wealthy cannot be extended sustainably to even the present world population using prevailing technology. In this light, sustainability may well depend on such measures as greater emphasis on equity in international relationships, significant adjustments to prevailing terms of trade, increasing regional self-reliance, and policies to stimulate a massive increase in the material and energy efficiency of economic activity.},

In this paper, we attempted to show which factors contributed to the changes in emission of the major greenhouse gas in South Korea and Japan. The changes in emission are analyzed in terms of emission intensity, input techniques, demand composition, and trade structures. According to our analysis, South Korea, a non-Annex I country, has more energy-intensive production structures than Japan, an Annex I country. South Korea's trade pattern with Japan reflects these production features, resulting in the Korea's comparative advantage in emission intensive products, though the degree has somewhat mitigated in 1995 compared to 1990.},

	Abstract = {When an environmental problem involves several agents, different environmental indicators can be chosen. In this paper we derive axiomatically an indicator of ``environmental responsibility'', the quantitative contribution of each agent to the environmental problem. This indicator must possess properties that most agents are likely to accept. Apart from a normalization condition, that indicator must be: (1) additive, implying that the responsibility of a set of agents is the sum of the responsibilities of each agent; (2) account for indirect effects under economic causality, implying that the agent that benefits economically from an environmental damage is responsible for it; (3) monotonic in direct environmental pressure, implying that the responsibility of a given agent cannot decrease if its actions lead to an overall worsening of the environmental problem; (4) symmetric in production and consumption, meaning that if the contribution of an agent's consumption and production behavior is interchanged, that agent's responsibility cannot change. We prove that an indicator fulfilling these properties exists and is unique, given by the average of the environmental pressure generated to produce the primary inputs and the final demand of an agent. The existence of a unique indicator of environmental responsibility can facilitate cooperation in environmental agreements and raise commitment in the implementation of environmental policies.},

	Abstract = {This paper compares two concepts to evaluate the international responsibility of a country with respect to its emissions. Using a multi-regional input--output model, we show that the trade emission balance and the responsibility emission balance yield the same result. In practical work, however, a lack of data availability implies that the same technology assumption has been commonly adopted. In that case, also a third alternative exists, which simply evaluates the emissions embodied in the trade balance of the country. This third alternative yields the same results as the other two approaches at the aggregate level. At the level of individual products, however, the results are clearly different and it turns out that the third alternative answers a different question. That is, it is appropriate for measuring the emission content of the products that cross the border. In our empirical application, we consider Spain in 1995 and 2000, distinguishing nine different gases: {CO2}, {CH4}, {N2O}, {SF6}, {HFCs}, {PFCs}, {SO2}, {NOx}, and {NH3.}},

Data were acquired from Iran's Environmental Protection Agency {(IEPA)} and the Ministry of Health {(MH).} These agencies operate five automated ambient air monitoring stations located in areas with heavy traffic. Daily samples of {SO} 2 , {NO} 2 , {CO}, total suspended particulate matter {(TSM)}, and hydrocarbons {(HC)} were collected to provide 24 hour averages for each pollutant. Every three months, mean concentrations were reported to {IEPA.} Composite samples from all five stations were stored in a databank operated by {IEPA.} The ambient air quality guidelines were obtained from {WHO} reports. Statistical analysis was carried out using a regression model, which was designed to fit the air pollution data and take into account missing data. The results showed that there was a statistically significant upward trend in air pollution levels for all of the measured pollutants, except {NO2}, during the years 1988 to 1993. {WHO} guidelines were routinely and substantially exceeded by all pollutants except {TSM.} These findings suggest that as the population continues to grow, and increasing numbers of motor vehicles are driven in Tehran, there is concern for the health effects that may result from exposure to these pollutants.},

In thelast decades, structural changes in {theBrazilian} economy were close related tochanges in the country's tradespecialization. This paper analyzes to whatextent energy use and its {associatedCO} 2 emissions of Brazil in the 90's maybe overloaded by changes in the country'strade specialization towards a moreenergy-intensive mix. This study finds {thatBrazil} exported, in net terms, significantamounts of energy and carbon {(C)} embodied ingoods traded with the rest of the world inthe 90's. In fact, some 6.6\% of the finalenergy used by the industrial sector andaround 7.1\% of its C emissions areprompted by international trade. Byoverloading the country's energy use andits associated environmental damage (bothlocal and global), this situation seems tocontribute to increase not only local butalso global environmental damage, {sinceC} leakage from non-Annex I countriesdue to international trade may lead tohigher C concentration in theatmosphere.},

	Abstract = {In recent years there have been a number of attempts to develop a more comprehensive approach to the issue of measuring resource use and/or pollution generation embodied in trade flows, including contributions that combine input--output techniques and Ecological Footprint analysis. In this two-part paper we describe how to enumerate the resource and/or pollution content of inter-regional and inter-national trade flows {(Part} 1) and we present a literature review of recent methodological and empirical developments {(Part} 2). It is straightforward in principle to extend the basic input--output approach to capture international trade flows. However, in practice, problems of data availability and compatibility, and of computability of extended input--output matrices, mean that simplifying assumptions are generally applied, but with the implications of these assumptions often not made fully explicit. What appears to be absent from previous applications is an account of the analytical method by which Ecological Footprints should ideally be estimated in an international input--output accounting analysis. This allows an explicit analysis of the problems that prevent the application of the full method and identification of the most appropriate short-cut methods in a transparent way. The objective of this paper is to provide such an account.},

	Abstract = {This paper offers a detailed review of recently described single- and multi-region input--output models used to assess environmental impacts of internationally traded goods and services. It is the second part of a two-part contribution. In Part 1 {[Turner}, K., Lenzen, M., Wiedmann, T. and Barrett, J. in press. Examining the Global Environmental Impact of Regional Consumption Activities --- Part 1: A Technical Note on Combining {Input--Output} and Ecological Footprint Analysis; Ecological Economics.] we describe how to enumerate the resource and pollution content of inter-regional and inter-national trade flows with the aim to illustrate an ideal accounting and modelling framework for the estimation of Ecological Footprints.
	
	A large number of such environment-economic models have been described but only in the last few years models have emerged that use a more sophisticated multi-region, multi-sector input--output framework. This has been made possible through improvements in data availability and quality as well as computability. We identify six major models that employ multi-sector, multi-region input--output analysis in order to calculate environmental impacts embodied in international trade. Results from the reviewed studies demonstrate that it is important to explicitly consider the production recipe, land and energy use as well as emissions in a multi-region, multi-sector and multi-directional trade model with global coverage and detailed sector disaggregation. Only then reliable figures for indicators of impacts embodied in trade, such as the Ecological Footprint, can be derived.},

@article{wiedmannallocating2006,
	Abstract = {We present and discuss a method that allows the disaggregation of national Ecological Footprints by economic sector, detailed final demand category, sub-national area or socio-economic group. This is done by combining existing National Footprint Accounts with input--output analysis. Calculations in the empirical part are carried out by using supply and use tables for the United Kingdom, covering the reporting period 2000. Ecological Footprints are allocated to detailed household consumption activities following the {COICOP} classification system and to a detailed breakdown of capital investment. The method presented enables the calculation of comparable Ecological Footprints on all sub-national levels and for different socio-economic groups. The novelty of the approach lies in the use of input--output analysis to re-allocate existing Footprint accounts, in the detail of disaggregation by consumption category and in the expanded use of household expenditure data. This extends the potential for applications of the Ecological Footprint concept and helps to inform scenarios, policies and strategies on sustainable consumption. The method described in this paper can be applied to every country for which a National Footprint Account exists and where appropriate economic and environmental accounts are available. The approach helps to save time in data collection and improves the consistency between Ecological Footprint estimates for a particular human society from different researchers. For these reasons, the suggested methodology includes crucial steps on the way towards a standardisation of Ecological Footprint accounts.},

	Abstract = {This paper explores the anatomy of Danish energy consumption and emissions of carbon dioxide {(CO2)}, sulphur dioxide {(SO},) and nitrogen oxides {(NO},). Changes in emissions between 1966 and 1988 were investigated using input-output structural decomposition analysis. Production-based emissions have undergone substantially greater changes than have private consumption emissions, and the increased level of final demand explains most of this development. Although the level of {CO} 2 emissions has risen proportionally to energy consumption, the {NO}, emissions level has increased relatively more and the {SO}, emissions level has declined considerably. There are several reasons for these developments, the main reason being changes in fuel mix in the energy-supply sector. Energy conservation has been implemented throughout the economy--with the important exception of transportation fuel. In most sectors and all demand categories, there has been a shift towards less energy-intensive composition of inputs and commodities. Both effects have considerably reduced emissions, but this has been outweighed by economic growth, which has required energy for further production throughout the whole period studied.},

@article{wiltingcarbon2009,
	Abstract = {National policies for reducing environmental pressures stemming from emissions and the use of natural resources usually adopt a producer approach, i.e. the legislation refers to pressures occurring within the territorial boundaries of a country. An alternative approach to environmental accounting is the consumer approach, which includes environmental pressures associated with imports for domestic consumption, wherever these pressures occur. The carbon footprint, for example, is such an approach, in which {CO2} or greenhouse gas {(GHG)} emissions are considered from a consumer's perspective. The consumer approach may offer new ways for policies to reduce pressures, and therefore it would be interesting to adopt this perspective in national environmental policy-making and international negotiations. To gain insight into the differences between the approaches, this paper discusses the concepts of both, showing the results of an empirical analysis and going into the application of the two different perspectives in (international) environmental policies. Due to international trade, the environmental pressures accounted for in a producer's and a consumer's perspective are usually not the same for a country. This paper presents a worldwide overview, comparing the outcomes for the two approaches with regard to {GHG} emissions and land use, for 12 world regions. Furthermore, for {GHG} emissions, a quantitative comparison was made between 87 countries and regions covering the world. Consumption-related {GHG} emissions and land use per capita were calculated with a full multi-regional input--output {(MRIO)} model. {MRIO} analysis is an attractive method for footprint analyses in an international context. The research shows that, for most developed countries, {GHG} emissions and land use are higher in the consumer approach than in the producer approach. For most developing countries, the opposite is true. Before applying national targets to the consumer approach -- for instance, in climate policies -- further improvements and standardisation of methodology and data will be necessary.},

The study is based on illness data (work loss days) for the Dutch labour population and average year concentrations of air pollution in 29 districts. The dose--response relationship has been estimated by means of two different techniques: the ordinary least squares method {(OLS)} and the one-way fixed-effects method {(OWFEM)}, which we consider to be more adequate. In general health effects are much smaller when {OWFEM} is applied than if {OLS} is used. With {OWFEM} a significant relationship is found between sulphate aerosol {(SO} 4 ), ammonia {(NH} 3 ) and the number of work loss days {(WLDs).} Particulates {(TSP)}, O 3 and {SO} 2 have no significant effect on the number of {WLDs.} These results differ from those obtained in studies in the United States, which indicate that particulates {(TSP)} and other small particles, ozone {(O} 3 ) and to a lesser extent {SO} 4 and {SO} 2 significantly influence the number of {WLDs.}},
